# Long Name
Powershell Deciphering Scripts

# Short Name 
PoShCiphers

# Short Description
This is a repository for Powershell-made deciphering scripts. 

# Long Description
This is a collection of all the ciphers I have made or have forked from other repositories. There are only two forked deciphering repositories. I will be continuing to add on to this repository and edit these scripts. 

# Future information
An Auto Deciphering script is coming soon. This script will give anyone the ability to paste the encoded message and, without a key, find the answer for you. It will essentially go through every cipher in the list and run your encrypted text in each one. It will output it to a list of all the potentially decoded strings and will match each potentially decoded word(s) in the string to a github database with 48,000 words from the english language. For long-term support, I could potentially be adding multiple layers of encryption support and multiple language support. The auto-key and aut-solver algorithms will be added to the Vigenere Cipher, the Ceasar Cipher, ROT47, and more.

# Side note

Please excuse anything unprofessional since this is a side project.
The main use case is for Cyberpatriot.
I may use it at a job if the job has anything to do with cryptology and cryptograms. 
If that is the case, I will pay attention to every detail.
