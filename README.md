# Long Name
Powershell Deciphering Scripts

# Short Name 
PoShCiphers

# Short Description
This is a repository for Powershell-made deciphering scripts. 

# Long Description
This is a collection of all the ciphers I have made or have forked from other repositories. There are only two forked deciphering repositories. I will be continuing to add on to this repository and edit these scripts. 

# Priorities
I will be focusing on the Auto_Cipher Powershell script. It was the main priority going into this project. However, if a bug appears, I will fix in the Auto_Cipher.ps1 script and the corresponding Decode_{Cipher}.ps1 script.

# Future information
The Auto Deciphering script* is here. This script will give anyone the ability to paste the encoded message and, without a key, find the answer for you. It will essentially go through every cipher in the list and run your encrypted text in each one. It will output it to a list of all the potentially decoded strings and will match each potentially decoded word(s) in the string to a github database with 48,000 words from the english language. For long-term support, I could potentially be adding multiple layers of encryption support and multiple language support. The auto-key and aut-solver algorithms will be added to the Vigenere Cipher, the Ceasar Cipher, ROT47, and more. 

There may be a few bugs. If there are bugs, please add a ticket in the ISSUES pane.
